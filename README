Devel::TraceUse
---------------

Show the modules your program loads, recursively.

An apparently simple program may load a lot of modules. That's useful, but
sometimes you may wonder exactly which part of your program loads which module.

Devel::TraceUse can analyze a program to see which part used which module. I
recommend using it from the command line:

  $ perl -d:TraceUse your_program.pl

This will display a tree of the modules ultimately used to run your program.
(It also runs your program with only a little startup cost all the way through
to the end.)

  Modules used from your_program.pl:
  Test::MockObject::Extends, line 6 (0.000514)
    Test::MockObject, line 6 (0.000408)
      Scalar::Util, line 9 (0.000521)
        List::Util, line 12 (0.000393)
          XSLoader, line 24 (0.000396)
      UNIVERSAL::isa, line 10 (0.000436)
        UNIVERSAL, line 8 (0.000247)
      UNIVERSAL::can, line 11 (0.000428)
      Test::Builder, line 13 (0.000413)
    Devel::Peek, line 8 (0.000693)
