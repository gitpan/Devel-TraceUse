Devel::TraceUse
---------------

Show the modules your program loads, recursively.

An apparently simple program may load a lot of modules. That's useful, but
sometimes you may wonder exactly which part of your program loads which module.

Devel::TraceUse can analyze a program to see which part used which module.
I recommend using it from the command line:

  $ perl -d:TraceUse your_program.pl

This will display a tree of the modules ultimately used to run your program.
(It also runs your program with only a little startup cost all the way through
to the end.)

  Modules used from your_program.pl:
     1.  strict, your_program.pl line 1 [main]
     2.  warnings, your_program.pl line 2 [main]
     3.  Getopt::Long, your_program.pl line 3 [main]
     4.    vars, Getopt/Long.pm line 37
     5.      warnings::register, vars.pm line 7
     6.    Exporter, Getopt/Long.pm line 43
     9.      Exporter::Heavy, Exporter.pm line 18
     7.    constant, Getopt/Long.pm line 226
     8.    overload, Getopt/Long.pm line 1487 [Getopt::Long::CallBack]
