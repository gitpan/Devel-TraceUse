Revision history for Devel-TraceUse

2.04 Sat Apr 16 13:57:19 CEST 2011
    - use ${"$package\::VERSION"} instead of $package->VERSION to
      avoid the validation in ->VERSION to choke on modules using
      base.pm (RT #65284)

2.03 Wed Sep 22 01:15:40 CEST 2010
    - The 'hidecore' option will hide core modules in the output
      (initial patch by David Leadbeater)
    - moved author tests to xt/

2.02 Wed Jul  7 17:41:16 CEST 2010
    - Added the module version (if available) to the output
    - Improved test suite for Win32 and sitecustomize.pl

2.01 Tue May 11 09:38:20 CEST 2010
    No code change, but:
    - improved test suite to work with Win32 and sitecustomize.pl
      (many thanks to Apocalypse (APOCAL) for Win32 testing)
    - work around search.cpan.org indexing

2.00 Thu Mar 25 23:17:02 CET 2010
    Complete rewrite by Philippe Bruhat (BooK):

    - report modules loaded but not attached to the loading tree
    - do not compute compilation time (it was wrong anyway)
    - extensive test suite
