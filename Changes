    Complete rewrite by Philippe Bruhat (BooK):
    - build a more correct load tree, including modules loaded at runtime
    - report failures to load a module
    - report modules loaded but not attached to the loading tree
    - do not compute compilation time (it was wrong anyway)
    - extensive test suite
