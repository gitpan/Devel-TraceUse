Revision history for Devel-TraceUse

2.09 Sat Feb 16 2013
    - added a proxy-reporting feature, that lists modules/subroutines
      found to load other modules --but no change to the tree output yet--
      (thanks to Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN))

2.08 Thu Sep 13 2012
    - fixed the module's encoding to match the =encoding POD directive

2.07 Thu Sep 13 2012
    - Added support for "perl -c": dump tree at CHECK phase if -c is set
      (contributed by Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN))

2.06 Sun Jan 15 00:44:13 CET 2012
    No code change, but:
    - More thoroughly remove @INC from the error output
    - do not open output test files as utf8
    - fix a warning when using a dev version of Module::CoreList

2.05 Mon Apr 18 10:02:08 CEST 2011
    - new 'output' option to redirect TraceUse result to a file
      (fully implemented by Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN) at the Perl QA
      Hackathon 2011)

2.04 Sat Apr 16 13:57:19 CEST 2011
    - use ${"$package\::VERSION"} instead of $package->VERSION to
      avoid the validation in ->VERSION to choke on modules using
      base.pm (RT #65284)

2.03 Wed Sep 22 01:15:40 CEST 2010
    - The 'hidecore' option will hide core modules in the output
      (initial patch by David Leadbeater)
    - moved author tests to xt/

2.02 Wed Jul  7 17:41:16 CEST 2010
    - Added the module version (if available) to the output
    - Improved test suite for Win32 and sitecustomize.pl

2.01 Tue May 11 09:38:20 CEST 2010
    No code change, but:
    - improved test suite to work with Win32 and sitecustomize.pl
      (many thanks to Apocalypse (APOCAL) for Win32 testing)
    - work around search.cpan.org indexing

2.00 Thu Mar 25 23:17:02 CET 2010
    Complete rewrite by Philippe Bruhat (BooK):
    - build a more correct load tree, including modules loaded at runtime
    - report failures to load a module
    - report modules loaded but not attached to the loading tree
    - do not compute compilation time (it was wrong anyway)
    - extensive test suite

1.00 Tue Jul 11 04:45:53 UTC 2006 (chromatic)
	First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
